   cd deus-proxy-server-ts
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables. Choose proxy server port and allowed IPs to access proxy:

```env
PORT=33000
ALLOWED_IPS=52.167.144.238,52.167.144.*,192.168.1.*,10.0.0.0/24
```

### Configuration Options

- `PORT`: The port number on which the proxy server will listen (default: 33000)
- `ALLOWED_IPS`: Comma-separated list of IP addresses or IP ranges that are allowed to use the proxy. Supports:
  - Individual IPs: `192.168.1.100`
